🌤️ Weather Advice Program

📌 Overview

This project is part of Week 4 – Control Flow in the ALX Backend Web Development with Python program.
It demonstrates the use of conditional statements (if, elif, else) to guide program execution based on user input.

The script asks the user about today’s weather and provides clothing recommendations accordingly.

🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn to:

Use if, elif, and else statements for decision-making in Python.

Handle expected and unexpected user input.
