# Python script that converts a specific number of hours into seconds

# variables for the convertion of hours to seconds
hours = 2
minutes_in_hour = 60
seconds_in_minutes = 60

# Formular for calculating the interest is (seconds = number of hours * number of minutes in an hour * number of seconds in a minute)
seconds = hours * minutes_in_hour * seconds_in_minutes

# The below prints the area of the rectangle base on the formular and the value of the variables specified above
print(hours, "hours is", seconds, "seconds")
